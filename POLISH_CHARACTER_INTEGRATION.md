## Technical Implementation

### **File Structure**
```
app/characters/
â”œâ”€â”€ character-types.ts           # Interface definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ lars-character-base.ts       # Polish Lars character (NEW)
â”œâ”€â”€ wiktoria-character-base.ts   # Polish Wiktoria character (NEW)

â””â”€â”€ wiktoria-character-enhance2.ts  # Previous version
```

### **Configuration Update**

### **Integration Points**
- `getLarsInitialPrompt()` â†’ Uses `${LarsCharacterBase.coreIdentity}`
- `getWiktoriaReflectPrompt()` â†’ Uses `${WiktoriaCharacterBase.coreIdentity}`

- All existing conversation flow maintained
