# Voice Detection & Phone Tone - Timing Adjustment Session

**Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **REVERTED - WORKING SOLUTION RESTORED**

## 🎯 Session Overview

**Initial Request**: User wanted phone tone to play longer - not cut off immediately on voice detection, but only when Lars starts speaking.

**Issue**: The modification broke the auto-start tone functionality.

**Resolution**: Reverted changes to restore working phone tone system.

## 🔧 Changes Made & Reverted

### Original Working Code (RESTORED)
```typescript
const handleVoiceDetected = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('🎤 Voice detected - stopping tone immediately');
  // Stop tone when voice is detected
  if (simpleToneRef.current) {
    simpleToneRef.current.stop();
  }
  setPhoneToneEnabled(false);
}, []);
```

### Attempted Modification (REVERTED)
```typescript
const handleVoiceDetected = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('🎤 Voice detected - but keeping tone until Lars speaks');
  // DON'T stop tone here - let it continue until agent speaks
}, []);
```

## 🎯 Current Working System

✅ **Phone tone starts automatically** on page load  
✅ **Voice detection works** with 0.025 threshold  
✅ **Tone stops immediately** when voice detected  
✅ **Exhibition mode** properly configured  
✅ **SimplePhoneTone class** functioning correctly

## 🎯 System State

**Working Implementation**: The system now works exactly as it did before the attempted modification. Phone tone plays automatically and stops immediately when voice is detected, triggering the call to start.

**Note**: The timing adjustment request was valid but broke the auto-start functionality. The working system should be preserved until a more careful implementation of the timing feature can be developed.
