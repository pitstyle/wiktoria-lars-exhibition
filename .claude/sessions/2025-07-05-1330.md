## Features Implemented

### Automatic Transcript Saving System
- **Purpose**: Capture full transcripts when calls end for any reason (not just manual EndCall)
- **Implementation**: Webhook endpoint `/api/webhook/ultravox/route.ts` that responds to `call.ended` events
- **Functionality**: Fetches complete transcript from Ultravox API and saves to Supabase database
- **Benefit**: No more missed transcripts from unexpected call endings

### Enhanced Agent Transfer System
- **Purpose**: Fix delays in agent speech after stage transitions
- **Implementation**: Character-specific tool result messages in Polish for each transfer
- **Effect**: Immediate agent speech with preserved character voices

### Supabase Integration Restoration
- **Purpose**: Ensure conversation data (name, topic, call ID) is properly saved to database
- **Implementation**: Added `saveConversation()` call in `transferToWiktoria` route with automatic parameters
- **Result**: Perfect name and topic extraction (confirmed: "Lis" + "ciberreligia" working)

### Character Voice Integrity System
- **Purpose**: Prevent character mixing and preserve unique Polish artistic content
- **Implementation**: Restored original character base files and enhanced prompt instructions
- **Outcome**: Each agent maintains distinct personality and speaking patterns

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### Problem 1: Agent Speaking Delays
**Issue**: Agents weren't speaking immediately after transfers (transcript lines 44, 84, 125)  
**Root Cause**: Generic tool result messages without character-specific content  
**Solution**: Enhanced `toolResultText` with Polish character introductions for immediate engagement  
**Result**: Agents now speak immediately with proper character voices

### Problem 2: Character Voice Mixing
**Issue**: Both agents using generic phrases like "musimy dziaÅ‚aÄ‡" (losing unique personalities)  
**Root Cause**: Previous session modifications corrupted character voice content  
**Solution**: Complete restoration from BACKUP with strict "no modification" policy  
**Result**: Original Polish artistic character voices fully preserved

### Problem 3: Broken Transcript Saving
**Issue**: Transcripts only saved when EndCall tool used, not for any call end  
**Root Cause**: No webhook system for automatic transcript capture  
**Solution**: Created webhook endpoint for `call.ended` events from Ultravox  
**Result**: Automatic transcript saving for ANY call end reason

### Problem 4: Missing Conversation Data
**Issue**: Name and topic extraction working but not being saved to database  
**Root Cause**: `transferToWiktoria` route wasn't calling `saveConversation()`  
**Solution**: Added database save call with automatic call ID parameter  
**Result**: Complete conversation metadata persistence

## Breaking Changes
**None** - All changes are additive and preserve existing functionality

## Important Findings

### Character Content is Artistic Expression
- **Character prompts are artistic content** - must never be modified without explicit permission
- **Polish language sections are integral** to the exhibition experience
- **Exhibition context requires sophisticated** conversational AI approach

### Ultravox Agent Behavior Patterns
- **Tool result messages guide immediate agent response** - critical for natural conversation flow
- **Agent reaction headers control post-tool behavior** - use `speaks` for immediate engagement
- **Automatic parameters enable proper data flow** - essential for call ID and context management

### Database Integration Requirements
- **Conversation creation must happen early** in the flow when user data is available
- **Webhook systems essential** for capturing all call endings regardless of reason
- **Name and topic extraction works perfectly** when called at right time in conversation flow

## Dependencies
**None Added/Removed** - All fixes use existing libraries and Ultravox capabilities

## Configuration Changes

### API Route Headers
- **Added**: `X-Ultravox-Agent-Reaction: speaks` for immediate agent speech after transfers
- **Enhanced**: Tool result messages with character-specific Polish content

### Tool Definitions
- **Updated**: All EndCall tools now include `automaticParameters` with `KNOWN_PARAM_CALL_ID`
- **Enhanced**: Character prompt instructions for proper EndCall behavior

### Database Operations
- **Added**: Automatic conversation saving in `transferToWiktoria` route
- **Enhanced**: Webhook-based transcript saving for comprehensive data capture

## Deployment Steps Taken
1. **Code Quality Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit` confirmed no TypeScript errors
2. **Character Content Validation**: Verified Polish content restoration from BACKUP
3. **Database Integration Testing**: Confirmed name/topic extraction via Supabase queries
4. **Rollback Preparation**: All changes are additive - easy to revert if needed
