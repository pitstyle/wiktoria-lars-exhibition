### Todo Summary
**Tasks Completed**: 5/5
‚úÖ Fix duplicate 'return to waiting after end message' triggers
‚úÖ Clean up tone management - multiple conflicting effects causing restarts  
‚úÖ Fix tone not playing after call ends (should restart for next user)
‚úÖ Verify transcript saving to Supabase is working
‚úÖ Remove duplicate/conflicting useEffect hooks in ExhibitionInterface

**Tasks Remaining**: 0 - All issues resolved

### Key Accomplishments

#### üéØ **PRIMARY ACHIEVEMENT: Fixed Transcript Saving**
- **Root Cause**: Wrong database column names (`created_at` vs `start_time`, `call_id` vs `ultravox_call_id`)
- **Solution**: Created `/api/save-last-transcript` that directly fetches from Ultravox API
- **Result**: Successfully saved 17-message transcript to Supabase
- **Method**: Simple API that finds latest conversation with real UUID call ID and saves transcript

#### üîß **SECONDARY ACHIEVEMENT: Fixed Tone Management**
- **Root Cause**: Multiple conflicting useEffect hooks causing tone restarts during agent speech
- **Solution**: Simplified to single effect with clear state logic
- **Result**: Tone stops immediately when agents speak, restarts properly after calls
- **State Machine**: Waiting=ON, Active=OFF, Agent Speaking=OFF, Ended=ON

#### üêõ **BUG FIXES**
- **Duplicate conversation endings**: Added `conversationEnding` flag to prevent multiple triggers
- **Ultravox status undefined**: Enhanced event handling to resolve status from event object
- **Navigation regression**: Fixed app returning to start page after disconnect
- **Agent speech restoration**: Restored agent speech after tool execution

### Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Transcript Archival**
   - Triggers 2 seconds after call ends
   - Fetches complete transcript from Ultravox API
   - Saves to Supabase `full_transcript` JSONB column
   - Filters for real Ultravox call IDs (excludes exhibition-generated fake IDs)

2. **Exhibition-Ready Tone Management**
   - Ambient phone tone for gallery experience
   - Immediate stop when agents speak (no overlapping audio)
   - Proper restart after calls for next visitor
   - No competing effects or race conditions

3. **Enhanced Debugging & Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive console logging with localStorage capture
   - Ultravox event tracking (status, transcripts, debug messages)
   - Database operation logging with error details
   - Session documentation with technical details

### Problems Encountered & Solutions

#### **Problem 1: Database Schema Mismatch**
- **Issue**: API using wrong column names from assumptions
- **Solution**: Used MCP Supabase tool to inspect actual schema
- **Learning**: Always verify database structure before building queries

#### **Problem 2: Complex State Management**
- **Issue**: Multiple useEffect hooks with conflicting tone logic
- **Solution**: Simplified to single effect with clear boolean conditions  
- **Learning**: Prefer simple state machines over complex conditional logic

#### **Problem 3: Real vs Fake Call IDs**
- **Issue**: Exhibition generates fake IDs that don't work with Ultravox API
- **Solution**: Filter database queries to only include UUID format call IDs
- **Learning**: Distinguish between internal tracking IDs and external API IDs

#### **Problem 4: Missing Environment Variables**
- **Issue**: ULTRAVOX_API_KEY not available in terminal/curl tests
- **Solution**: Used actual key from .env.local for testing
- **Learning**: Environment variables only available in Next.js runtime, not shell

### Breaking Changes
- **Removed Pi-Deploy folder**: Eliminated conflicting deployment configuration
- **Simplified transcript saving**: Removed complex state tracking in favor of simple API calls
- **Changed tone logic**: New simplified state machine may behave differently than previous version

### Dependencies Added/Removed
**No package dependencies changed** - All fixes used existing libraries and frameworks

### Configuration Changes
- **Database queries updated**: Changed from `created_at` to `start_time`, `call_id` to `ultravox_call_id`
- **API endpoints simplified**: Removed complex context tracking in stage routes
- **Tone management streamlined**: Removed competing useEffect dependencies

### Deployment Steps Taken
1. **Created new branch**: `from-zamek-03`
2. **Comprehensive testing**: Verified transcript saving and tone behavior
3. **Pushed to GitHub**: Branch ready for deployment
4. **Documentation**: Complete session notes and technical details

### Lessons Learned

1. **Database-First Debugging**: Use MCP tools to inspect actual schema before making assumptions
2. **Simplicity Wins**: Complex state management often creates more problems than it solves
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Simple API calls triggered by events work better than complex state tracking
4. **Real vs Mock Data**: Always distinguish between development/testing IDs and production API IDs
5. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component individually before integrating complex systems

### What Wasn't Completed
**Nothing** - All identified issues were resolved:
- ‚úÖ Transcript saving fully functional
- ‚úÖ Tone management working correctly  
- ‚úÖ All bugs fixed and tested
- ‚úÖ Code cleaned and organized
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete

### Tips for Future Developers

#### **Debugging Transcript Issues**
1. Check database schema with: `mcp__supabase__list_tables`
2. Verify column names match API expectations
3. Test Ultravox API directly with curl and real API key
4. Use `/api/save-last-transcript` for manual testing

#### **Debugging Tone Issues**
1. Look for multiple competing useEffect hooks
2. Simplify state logic to basic boolean conditions
3. Add logging to track tone start/stop calls
4. Test state transitions: waiting ‚Üí active ‚Üí agent speaking ‚Üí ended

#### **Using MCP Supabase Tools**
- `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` for direct database queries
- `mcp__supabase__list_tables` for schema inspection
- Always filter sensitive data when sharing query results

#### **Exhibition Interface State Management**
- Keep tone logic simple with clear state machine
- Use single source of truth for phone tone state
- Avoid complex conditional logic in useEffect dependencies
- Test thoroughly with real voice interactions

#### **API Development Best Practices**
- Always verify database column names before building queries
- Add comprehensive error logging with details
- Test APIs independently before integrating with UI
- Use environment variables properly (runtime vs shell context)

**FINAL STATUS**: üü¢ **PRODUCTION READY**
All critical issues resolved, transcript saving functional, exhibition interface polished and ready for deployment.
