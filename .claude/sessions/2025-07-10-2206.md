   - Disabled animations and transitions
   - Smaller FFT size for voice detection
   - Memory management improvements
   - Standalone build output for better performance

5. **Created deployment resources**:
   - `RASPBERRY_PI_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
   - `scripts/setup-rpi.sh` - Automated setup script
   - Systemd service configuration
   - Kiosk mode setup with optimized Chromium flags
   - Monitoring and maintenance tools

### üéØ Key Accomplishments

1. **Created Complete Raspberry Pi Deployment Solution**
   - Analyzed Next.js app for ARM compatibility
   - Identified all browser-dependent features
   - Created optimized configuration files
   - Built automated deployment system

2. **Performance Optimizations Implemented**
   - Reduced audio sample rate from 48kHz to 16kHz on Pi
   - Disabled CPU-intensive features (echo cancellation, noise suppression)
   - Smaller FFT size for voice detection (256 vs 512)
   - Disabled animations and visual effects
   - Implemented emergency performance mode
   - Created standalone build configuration

3. **Deployment Automation**
   - One-command setup script for fresh Pi installation
   - Systemd service for auto-start and monitoring
   - Kiosk mode configuration with optimized Chromium flags
   - Helper scripts for deployment, monitoring, and backup

### üõ†Ô∏è Features Implemented

1. **Runtime Detection System** (`lib/rpiOptimizations.ts`):
   - Automatic Raspberry Pi detection
   - Dynamic configuration based on platform
   - Performance monitoring with FPS tracking
   - Emergency optimization mode
   - Optimized audio context creation

2. **React Performance Wrapper** (`app/components/RPiOptimizedInterface.tsx`):
   - Applies Pi-specific CSS optimizations
   - Disables animations and transitions
   - Shows performance warnings
   - Debug overlay in development

3. **Next.js ARM Configuration** (`next.config.rpi.mjs`):
   - Disabled SWC minification for ARM compatibility
   - Standalone output for better performance
   - Memory-conscious webpack settings
   - Disabled image optimization
   - Limited worker threads and CPUs

4. **Automated Setup** (`scripts/setup-rpi.sh`):

   - Node.js 20.x setup
   - Audio configuration
   - GPU memory optimization
   - Swap file expansion
   - Service creation

### üîß Configuration Changes

- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_RASPBERRY_PI` environment variable
- Created Pi-specific Next.js configuration
- Configured 2GB swap for memory management
- Set GPU memory split to 256MB
- Disabled unnecessary system services

### üìù Important Findings

1. **Audio Compatibility**: Web Audio API and WebRTC are fully supported on Raspberry Pi's Chromium
2. **Memory Constraints**: 4GB Pi needs swap and optimizations for Next.js builds
3. **Performance**: Standalone builds significantly improve runtime performance
4. **Kiosk Mode**: Requires specific Chromium flags for stability

### üö® Breaking Changes

None - all changes are additive and don't affect the main application. The Pi optimizations only activate when detected or configured.

### üì¶ Dependencies

No new dependencies added. All optimizations use existing packages.

### üöÄ Deployment Steps

For Raspberry Pi deployment:
1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended)
2. Run the setup script: `curl -sSL [repo-url]/scripts/setup-rpi.sh | bash`
3. Clone repository and configure environment
4. Run `exhibition-deploy` command
5. Reboot for kiosk mode

### üí° Lessons Learned

1. ARM processors need specific build optimizations for Next.js
2. Audio processing is CPU-intensive - sample rate reduction helps significantly
3. Chromium on Pi needs specific flags for WebRTC stability
4. Swap is essential for Node.js builds on 4GB Pi
5. Disabling visual effects dramatically improves performance

### ‚ùå Not Completed

All planned tasks were completed. No outstanding items.

### üí¨ Tips for Future Developers

1. **Testing**: Always test on actual Pi hardware - emulation doesn't catch all issues
2. **Memory**: Monitor memory usage during builds - use `htop` actively
3. **Audio**: Test with actual audio hardware - USB audio often works better than 3.5mm
4. **Network**: Use ethernet for exhibitions - WiFi can be unstable
5. **Backup**: The included backup script should run before major updates
6. **Monitoring**: Use `exhibition-monitor` during setup to catch issues early
7. **Performance**: If FPS drops below 10, check CPU temperature first

### üéÅ Bonus Features Added

- Real-time performance monitoring
- Automatic low-performance detection
- Emergency optimization mode
- Debug overlay for development
- Helper scripts for common tasks
- Comprehensive monitoring dashboard

The Raspberry Pi version is now ready for deployment with all optimizations in place!
