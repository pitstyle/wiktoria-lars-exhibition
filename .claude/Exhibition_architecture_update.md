‚è∫ üéâ Voice Activation System Complete!

  The dual-mode voice activation system has been successfully implemented and builds without errors. Here's what was accomplished:

  ‚úÖ Core Features Implemented

  1. Dual-Mode System: Keeps buttons for web, adds voice activation for exhibition
  2. Voice Activity Detection: WebAudio API-based VAD with configurable thresholds
  3. Audio Intro Loop: System for playing "M√≥w, start to speak, nie b√≥j siƒô..."
  4. Exhibition Interface: Full-screen, minimal UI optimized for visitors
  5. Session Management: Auto-timeout and cleanup for exhibition sessions
  6. Environment Configuration: Easy mode switching via environment variables

  üß™ Testing Instructions

  Web Mode (Default):
  npm run dev
  # Visit http://localhost:3000 - should show normal button interface

  Exhibition Mode (Voice Activation):
  # Method 1: URL parameter
  npm run dev
  # Visit http://localhost:3000?exhibition=true

  # Method 2: Environment variable  
  NEXT_PUBLIC_EXHIBITION_MODE=true npm run dev
  # Visit http://localhost:3000

  Debug Mode:
  # Add debug info to either mode
  http://localhost:3000?showDebugMessages=true
  http://localhost:3000?exhibition=true&showDebugMessages=true

  üéØ Exhibition Mode Features

  - Voice Activation: Detects voice and auto-starts conversations
  - Audio Intro Loop: Plays intro message while waiting (uses existing audio file as fallback)
  - Session Timeout: 45-second auto-timeout for visitor sessions
  - Minimal UI: Full-screen black interface optimized for exhibition
  - Automatic Reset: Returns to waiting state after each session

  üöÄ Ready for Exhibition

  The system is now ready for the July 18th exhibition with:
  - Production web version unchanged and stable
  - Exhibition voice activation fully implemented
  - Easy deployment via environment configuration
  - Raspberry Pi ready for hardware deployment

  Only remaining task is hardware optimization for vintage handsets, which can be fine-tuned during exhibition setup.
