# Remaining Fixes for Next Session

## Completed in This Session ✅
- Fixed languageHint: "auto" for Polish transcription 
- Corrected API route structure (safety filter issues resolved)
- Enhanced agent detection patterns
- Fixed UI color coding (all RED labels)
- Implemented natural conversation endings with invitation to call again
- Integrated friend's authentic character content
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Still Needs Testing/Validation ⚠️
1. **Polish Speech Transcription**: Verify `languageHint: "auto"` captures Polish speech correctly
2. **Agent Label Accuracy**: Test if enhanced detection patterns correctly identify Lars vs Wiktoria
3. **Conversation Ending Timing**: Validate 6-stage ending triggers work consistently
4. **Voice Switching**: Test voice ID changes during stage transitions
5. **Character Bleeding**: Ensure Wiktoria doesn't show Lars characteristics and vice versa

## Potential Improvements for Future
- Fine-tune agent detection keywords if mislabeling persists
- Optimize conversation flow timing
- Add fallback mechanisms for voice detection
- Consider adding language toggle for exhibitions
- Improve transition smoothness between stages

## Test Priority Order
1. Test Polish transcription first (core functionality)
2. Validate agent labeling (user experience critical)  
3. Test full conversation flow end-to-end
4. Verify graceful endings with reinvitation
5. Edge case testing (rapid switching, interruptions)
