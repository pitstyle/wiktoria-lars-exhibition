# Ultravox Implementation - Project Status

## ‚úÖ Successfully Built (Current Working State)

### Basic Foundation - Dr. Donut Tutorial
- **‚úÖ Next.js Server**: Running on localhost:3000
- **‚úÖ ngrok Tunnel**: `https://1457-31-178-4-112.ngrok-free.app` (forwarding to port 3000)
- **‚úÖ Ultravox API Integration**: Working correctly (POST /api/ultravox returns 201)
- **‚úÖ Voice Calls**: Successfully connect and respond
- **‚úÖ Stage Transitions**: Dr. Donut ‚Üí Manager escalation works
- **‚úÖ Webhook Endpoints**: `/api/escalateToManager` responds correctly (200)

### Key Files Working
- `app/demo-config.ts`: Basic Dr. Donut configuration with escalation tool
- `app/api/escalateToManager/route.ts`: Stage transition endpoint (functional)
- `app/api/ultravox/route.ts`: Main API integration (functional)
- `lib/types.ts`: Correct ParameterLocation enums (fixed BODY ‚Üí PARAMETER_LOCATION_BODY)

### Current Functionality
- **Voice System**: Users can start calls and talk to Dr. Donut
- **Tool Integration**: Manager escalation triggers when users complain
- **Stage Changes**: Seamless transitions between Dr. Donut and Manager
- **Voice Switching**: Basic voice change (though both use similar voices currently)

## üéØ Next Phase: Lars ‚Üî Wiktoria Implementation

### Goal
Replace Dr. Donut system with Lars ‚Üî Wiktoria conversation flow:
1. **Lars** (Voice: `3274a450-a199-4421-8b16-fdfa923ccf23`) - Collects name + topic
2. **Wiktoria** (Voice: `2e40bf21-8c36-45db-a408-5a3fc8d833db`) - Shares opinion + engages user

### Required Changes
- [ ] Update `demo-config.ts` with Lars initial configuration
- [ ] Create `/api/transferToWiktoria` endpoint
- [ ] Implement 2-stage conversation flow
- [ ] Add custom voice IDs for personality switching
- [ ] Test full conversation cycle

### Architecture Advantages
- **Zero-gap transfers**: Single call with stage transitions (solves ElevenLabs 26-43s silence issue)
- **Working foundation**: Built on proven Dr. Donut tutorial base
- **Webhook system**: Reliable stage transition mechanism
- **Error-free**: No more WebSocket/SDK compatibility issues

## üìù Previous Context
This builds on extensive work with ElevenLabs multi-agent system that had post-transfer silence issues. Ultravox Call Stages approach eliminates these problems through single-call stage transitions instead of separate agent calls.

## üîß Environment Setup
```bash
# Current working directory
cd /Users/peterstyle/Developer/11labs_wikiANDlars/ultravox_implementation/ultravox-tutorial-call-stages

# Server running
npm run dev  # localhost:3000

# ngrok tunnel active
# https://1457-31-178-4-112.ngrok-free.app

# API key configured in .env.local
```

**Status**: Lars ‚Üî Wiktoria implemented with three config variations tested. Enhanced config (#2) selected as starting point for next development phase.

## Version History
- **v1.1.0** (2025-06-17): UI redesign to AI Political Performance theme + Ultravox client bugfix
- **v1.0.0** (2025-06-17): Initial Lars ‚Üî Wiktoria implementation with enhanced config selected and tested

## Configuration Analysis:
- **Config #1 (Basic)**: Simple, straightforward - functional baseline
- **Config #2 (Enhanced)**: ‚úÖ **SELECTED** - Maintains character consistency and flow across 4 stages
- **Config #3 (Theatrical)**: Interesting and very emotional but too chaotic - characters melt into one, losing distinct personalities

## Next Steps (Config #2 Improvements):
- **Lars Stage 1**: Should welcome user immediately (no delay)
- **Wiktoria Stage 2**: Remove self-introduction (already established in flow)

Currently testing enhanced config for character consistency validation.
