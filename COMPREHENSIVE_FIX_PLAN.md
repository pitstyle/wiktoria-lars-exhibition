## üö® **CRITICAL ERRORS IDENTIFIED**

### **CATEGORY A: CORE FLOW LOGIC FAILURES (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

#### **A1. Stage Sequencing Completely Broken**
- **Issue**: Wrong stage sequence execution
- **Expected**: Stage 1 (Lars collect) ‚Üí Stage 2 (Wiktoria opinion) ‚Üí Stage 3 (Lars perspective) ‚Üí Stage 4 (Wiktoria synthesis)
- **Actual**: Stage 1 ‚Üí Stage 2 (broken behavior) ‚Üí Stage 3 (immediate/premature) ‚Üí Flow breaks
- **Impact**: Users don't get proper conversation experience
- **Evidence**: Transcript shows Wiktoria asking "What would you like to discuss?" instead of giving expert opinion

#### **A2. Lars Auto-Transfer Failure**
- **Issue**: Lars doesn't automatically transfer to Wiktoria after collecting info
- **Expected**: Auto-call `transferToWiktoria` after name + topic collection
- **Actual**: Lars waits for user to manually ask "where is Victoria?"
- **Impact**: 8+ minute delay, user confusion, broken flow
- **Evidence**: Transcript shows user asking "where is Victoria?" at 08:40, transfer happens at 10:02

#### **A3. Wiktoria Stage 2 Behavior Completely Wrong**
- **Issue**: Wiktoria not following Stage 2 prompt correctly
- **Expected**: "Hello [name]. Your topic has been processed. [Expert opinion]. What's your experience with [topic]?"
- **Actual**: "What would you like to discuss, to debate, or to explore?"
- **Impact**: Conversation flow breaks, users confused about purpose
- **Evidence**: Transcript line shows wrong question instead of expert opinion

#### **A4. Premature Stage 3 Activation**
- **Issue**: Lars perspective called immediately without Wiktoria completing Stage 2
- **Expected**: Stage 3 only after user responds to Wiktoria's experience question
- **Actual**: `requestLarsPerspective` called at 10:56 before any user interaction with Wiktoria
- **Impact**: Skips entire Stage 2 conversation, users don't get to engage

### **CATEGORY B: CHARACTER BEHAVIOR ISSUES (HIGH PRIORITY)**

#### **B1. Lars Excessive Verbosity**
- **Issue**: Lars gives 3+ minute monologues before transferring
- **Expected**: Concise collection (30-60 seconds) then transfer
- **Actual**: 3:14 initial response, 1:45 second response, 1:11 third response
- **Impact**: Users lose interest, flow feels broken
- **Evidence**: Transcript timestamps show excessive response lengths

#### **B2. Missing Character Introductions**
- **Issue**: Neither Lars nor Wiktoria properly introduce themselves or the performance
- **User Request**: "Lars and Wiktoria should shortly introduce themselves who they are and what for?"
- **Expected**: Clear explanation of roles and purpose
- **Actual**: No introductions, users confused about context
- **Impact**: Users don't understand what the experience is

#### **B3. Missing Performance Rules Explanation**
- **Issue**: No explanation of what "political performance" entails
- **User Request**: "Lars should introduce the rules of the 'political performance' to the user"
- **Expected**: Clear context about AI W≈Çadza sztuki exhibition and format
- **Actual**: Users thrown into conversation without context
- **Impact**: Confusion about purpose and expectations

### **CATEGORY C: UI & TECHNICAL ISSUES (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### **C1. Agent Label Switching Bug**
- **Issue**: Corner labels show wrong agent
- **User Report**: "Agent labels are not working correctly switching to Wiktoria when Lars was speaking"
- **Expected**: Dynamic switching based on actual speaker
- **Actual**: Incorrect labels during conversation
- **Impact**: Users can't tell who's speaking

#### **C2. Exhibition Name Error**
- **Issue**: Wrong Polish spelling in prompts
- **User Report**: "Error in the name of the exhibition in Polish it should be: AI W≈Çadza sztuki"
- **Current**: "AI W≈Çadza Sztarti" (incorrect)
- **Should Be**: "AI W≈Çadza sztuki" (correct)
- **Impact**: Authenticity and accuracy issues

#### **C3. No Conversation Ending Logic**
- **Issue**: Conversation continues indefinitely
- **User Request**: "The dialog should end after the second run with info that one can call one more time"
- **Expected**: Clear ending after 2 loops with re-engagement option
- **Actual**: No ending mechanism
- **Impact**: Users don't know when/how conversation concludes

### **CATEGORY D: DATA COLLECTION ENHANCEMENTS (LOWER PRIORITY)**

#### **D1. Enhanced Data Collection Request**
- **User Request**: "We can add the weight to the data collection"
- **Current**: Basic name/age/occupation/topic collection
- **Enhancement**: Add importance weighting to collected data
- **Purpose**: Better data analysis and user profiling

#### **D2. Database Storage Missing**
- **User Request**: "We should add database to store the data collected by Lars and to store the transcript and mp3 of the full call"
- **Current**: No persistent storage
- **Enhancement**: Full data persistence system
- **Components**: User data, conversation transcripts, audio recordings

### **CATEGORY E: LANGUAGE & LOCALIZATION (FUTURE)**

#### **E1. Polish Language Support**
- **User Request**: "We should add Polish to language to use as a main one but with option to switch for the language of the user"
- **Current**: English only
- **Enhancement**: Polish as primary with language switching
- **Impact**: Better localization for Warsaw exhibition

#### **E2. Horizontal UI Layout Issue**
- **User Note**: "The horizontal UI should be corrected but this is for latter"
- **Status**: Acknowledged for future work
- **Priority**: Low (explicitly stated as later)
