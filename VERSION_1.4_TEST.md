# Version 1.4-test: Friend Code Integration & System Fixes

## Overview
This version integrates cleaned codebase from friend with comprehensive fixes for conversation flow, UI elements, and multilingual support.

## Key Features

### üîß **Core System Fixes**
- **Language Detection**: Changed to `languageHint: "auto"` for Polish/English auto-detection
- **API Route Structure**: Fixed all stage transition routes to match working format
- **Safety Filter Issues**: Resolved "I can't help with that request" by correcting API configurations
- **Call Stages**: Proper implementation of Ultravox stage transitions with immutable prompt frames

### üé® **UI Improvements**  
- **Agent Labels**: Inline RED labels within transcript instead of corner labels
- **Color Coding**: USER=RED, LARS=RED, WIKTORIA=RED for consistency
- **Agent Detection**: Enhanced pattern matching for correct label switching
- **Transcript Display**: Color-coded conversation flow with capital agent names

### üó£Ô∏è **Conversation Flow Enhancements**
- **4-Stage System**: Stage 1 (Lars Collector) ‚Üí Stage 2 (Wiktoria Opinion) ‚Üí Stage 3 (Lars Perspective) ‚Üí Stage 4 (Wiktoria Engager) ‚Üí Stage 6 (Ending)
- **Natural Endings**: Conversation concludes after 2-3 complete cycles with graceful invitation to call again
- **Stage 2 Optimization**: Wiktoria waits for substantial user responses before requesting Lars perspective
- **Data Collection**: Lars must collect actual names and specific topics (not generic placeholders)

### üé≠ **Character Integration**
- **Friend's Content**: Preserved authentic Polish political context and CUKT history from friend's implementation
- **Rich Prompts**: Maintained friend's atmospheric character descriptions while fixing flow logic
- **Exhibition Context**: "AI W≈Çadza sztuki" exhibition setting with proper Polish spelling

### üåç **Multilingual Support**
- **Auto-Detection**: Supports both English and Polish speech transcription
- **Exhibition Polish**: Correct "AI W≈Çadza sztuki" spelling throughout
- **Character Authenticity**: Preserved Polish political art context

## Technical Architecture

### **Call Stage Implementation**
```typescript
// Each stage completely replaces the LLM's interpretive frame
Stage 1: Lars systemPrompt + transferToWiktoria tool
Stage 2: Wiktoria systemPrompt + requestLarsPerspective tool  
Stage 3: Lars systemPrompt + returnToWiktoria tool
Stage 4: Wiktoria systemPrompt + conversation loop/ending logic
```

### **API Routes Fixed**
- `/api/transferToWiktoria` - Lars to Wiktoria transition
- `/api/requestLarsPerspective` - Wiktoria to Lars perspective
- `/api/returnToWiktoria` - Lars back to Wiktoria for synthesis

### **Agent Detection Logic**
- **Lars Keywords**: "synthetic party", "chaos", "void", "anarchic", "!?!!?!"
- **Wiktoria Keywords**: "system analysis", "calculated", "optimization", "technical", "cukt"

## Known Issues (Remaining)
- Agent label switching may need fine-tuning in edge cases
- Conversation ending timing could be optimized
- Voice ID switching accuracy during rapid transitions

## File Changes
- Enhanced `lars-wiktoria-enhanced-config.ts` with friend's character content
- Fixed all API route files (`transferToWiktoria`, `requestLarsPerspective`, `returnToWiktoria`)
- Updated `page.tsx` with improved agent detection and UI styling
- Added comprehensive character files from friend's implementation

## Testing Status
- ‚úÖ 4-stage conversation flow working
- ‚úÖ Auto-language detection implemented  
- ‚úÖ Agent color coding corrected
- ‚úÖ Natural conversation endings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Polish transcription requires testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent label accuracy needs validation

## Next Steps
- Test Polish speech transcription with `languageHint: "auto"`
- Validate agent label switching accuracy
- Fine-tune conversation ending triggers
- Optimize voice switching detection
