# Complete Pi Deployment Guide - July 15, 2025 (Post-Fixes)

## 🎯 **COMPREHENSIVE DEPLOYMENT WITH ALL LATEST FIXES**

**Updated**: July 15, 2025 after critical fixes session  
**Status**: Exhibition ready with all issues resolved  
**Deployment Time**: ~30 minutes per Pi (5 minutes for USB audio)

---

## **📋 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED (July 15, 2025)**

### ✅ **Phone Tone Auto-Restart**
- **Issue**: Tone wouldn't restart after conversation ended
- **Fix**: Enhanced `returnToWaitingState` function with user gesture preservation
- **Result**: Automatic tone restart when returning to waiting state

### ✅ **Tool Availability Errors**
- **Issue**: "Tool does not exist" errors after 6 exchanges
- **Fix**: Increased threshold from 6 to 12 exchanges
- **Result**: Extended conversation capability (12+ exchanges)

### ✅ **Character Voice Contamination**
- **Issue**: Lars speaking in 3rd person, adopting Wiktoria's style
- **Fix**: Strengthened identity guards in all prompts
- **Result**: Consistent character voices throughout conversation

### ✅ **JSON Speaking Bug**
- **Issue**: Wiktoria verbalizing tool calls instead of executing them
- **Fix**: Explicit tool usage instructions with critical warnings
- **Result**: Silent tool execution, natural conversation flow

### ✅ **Cold Start Timeouts**
- **Issue**: First tool calls timing out (>2.5s) on Pi
- **Fix**: Warming scripts + keep-alive service + graceful timeout handling
- **Result**: Fast tool responses (<1s) and automatic retry

### ✅ **Transcript Saving**
- **Issue**: Full transcript field empty in Supabase
- **Fix**: Preserved working system, reverted problematic changes
- **Result**: Reliable transcript saving with 3-tier fallback

### 2. **Push to GitHub**
```bash
git push origin pi-production-v2
```

---

## **🏗️ PHASE 2: PI BUILD PROCESS**

### 1. **Run Pi-Specific Build**
```bash
./scripts/build-pi.sh
```

**What this does**:
- Switches to Next.js 13.5.6 (ARM compatible)
- Uses Pi-specific configs (`package.pi.json`, `next.config.pi.mjs`)
- Builds with memory constraints (1GB limit)
- Creates optimized ARM64 build

### 2. **Build Success Verification**
```bash
✅ Pi build completed successfully!
📊 Build size: 158kB (optimized)
🎯 Ready for Pi deployment!
```

---

## **🚀 PHASE 3: PI DEPLOYMENT**

### 1. **Deploy to Pi**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-pi.sh [PI_IP]
# Example: ./scripts/deploy-pi.sh 192.168.1.100
```

**What this does**:
- Backs up existing installation
- Transfers files via rsync (excludes unnecessary files)
- Installs dependencies on Pi
- Sets up systemd service for auto-start
- Verifies deployment success

### 2. **Deployment Success Verification**
```bash
✅ Deployment successful!
🌐 Exhibition running at: http://PI_IP:3000
🎭 Exhibition mode: http://PI_IP:3000?exhibition=true
```

## **🎧 PHASE 4: USB AUDIO SETUP (5 MINUTES)**

### **Critical: USB Audio is Card 3**
All USB audio adapters appear as card 3 on these Pis.

### **Method 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
ssh pitstyle@PI_IP "cd /home/pitstyle/exhibition && ./scripts/quick-usb-audio-setup.sh"
```

### **Method 2: Manual Setup**
```bash
ssh pitstyle@PI_IP

# Configure ALSA for USB audio (card 3)
cat > ~/.asoundrc << 'EOF'
defaults.pcm.card 3
defaults.ctl.card 3
EOF

# Configure PulseAudio/PipeWire
pactl set-default-sink alsa_output.usb-Generic_USB_Audio-00.analog-stereo
pactl suspend-sink alsa_output.usb-Generic_USB_Audio-00.analog-stereo 0

# Set volume to maximum
amixer -c 3 sset Speaker 100% unmute
amixer -c 3 sset Headphone 100% unmute
pactl set-sink-volume alsa_output.usb-Generic_USB_Audio-00.analog-stereo 100%

# Test audio
speaker-test -t wav -c 2 -D hw:3,0 -l 1
```

### **USB Audio Success Verification**
```bash
✅ ALSA configured for USB audio (card 3)
✅ PulseAudio/PipeWire configured  
✅ Volume set to maximum
🔊 Testing speaker output...
✅ USB Audio setup complete!
```

# Test exhibition mode
curl http://PI_IP:3000/?exhibition=true
# Should load exhibition interface
```

### **2. Audio Test**
1. **Connect USB audio adapter** to Pi
2. **Plug handset** into USB adapter

## **🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **No Audio Output**
```bash
# Check USB detection
aplay -l | grep USB  # Should show card 3

# Check PulseAudio sink
pactl list short sinks | grep usb

# Force wake sink
pactl suspend-sink alsa_output.usb-Generic_USB_Audio-00.analog-stereo 0

# Test ALSA directly
aplay -D hw:3,0 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Left.wav
```

#### **Voice Activation Not Working**
```bash
# Check microphone
arecord -l | grep USB  # Should show card 3

# Test browser permissions
# Open browser, check microphone permissions in settings
```

#### **Tool Timeout Errors**
```bash
# Check if warming script is running
ps aux | grep warm

# Manually warm functions
cd /home/pitstyle/exhibition && ./scripts/warm-functions.sh

# Check keep-alive service
systemctl --user status keep-alive
```

#### **Character Voice Issues**
- Check recent commit has all identity guards
- Verify no old cached prompts
- Test with fresh conversation

#### **Transcript Not Saving**
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify API key in .env.local
- Test endCall route manually
